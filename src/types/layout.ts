   *
   * A ***video*** block is designed to embed videos in all app surfaces (e.g. link unfurls, messages, modals, App Home) — anywhere you can put blocks! To use the video block within your app, you must have the ***links.embed:write*** scope.
   *
   * Requirements
   * - Video blocks can only be posted by apps; users are not allowed to post embedded videos directly from Block Kit Builder.
   * - Your app must have the the ***links.embed:write*** scope for both user and bot tokens.
   * - ***video_url*** has to be included in the {@link https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/link-unfurling#configuring_domains unfurl domains} specified in your app.
   * - ***video_url*** should be publicly accessible, unless the app relies on information received from the {@link https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/events-api Events API} payloads to make a decision on whether the viewer(s) of the content should have access. If so, the service could create a unique URL accessible only via Slack.
   * - ***video_url*** must be compatible with an embeddable iFrame.
   * - ***video_url*** must return a 2xx code OR 3xx with less than 5 redirects and an eventual 2xx.
   * - ***video_url*** must not point to any Slack-related domain.
   *
   * Constraints
   * - Embeddable video players only (audio-only permitted)
   * - Navigation, scrolling and overlays are not allowed within the iFrame.
   * - Interactivity (e.g. likes, comments, and reactions) are allowed within your player but shouldn't completely overlay or navigate away from the content being embedded. These interactions will be anonymous since no user data is transferred to the embedded view.
   *
   * The metadata received in the Block payload will be used to construct the description, provider, and title of the video in all clients. Developers have the flexibility to leave non-mandatory fields null and use other blocks to format this content.
